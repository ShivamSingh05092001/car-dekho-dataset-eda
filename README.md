# 📊 CarDekho Sales Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the CarDekho used-car dataset uploaded in the Jupyter notebook.  
The goal is to explore how different factors such as brand, fuel type, kilometers driven, ownership, and transmission affect the selling price of cars in India.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze overall price distribution of used cars  
- Perform brand-wise and fuel-wise sales analysis  
- Track relationship between kilometers driven and price  
- Study impact of car age and ownership  
- Identify correlations, missing values, and outliers  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Matplotlib** (Visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (EDA Implementation)  
- **Kaggle CSV/Excel Dataset**

## 📂 Project Files
- **`Car-Dekho_dataset_EDA.ipynb`** – Notebook containing all EDA steps  
- **Dataset file:** sourced from Kaggle 
- **README.md** – Documentation

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Univariate Analysis of prices and features  
- Bivariate Analysis (Brand vs Price, KM vs Price)  
- Multivariate correlation matrix  
- Outlier detection using statistical methods  

---

## 📌 Outcomes
- Market is dominated by Maruti, Hyundai, Honda segments  
- Diesel cars show comparatively higher resale value  
- Price decreases as car age and kilometers increase  
- Automatic transmission cars tend to be costlier  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Price prediction using Machine Learning models  
- Dashboard development from notebook insights  
- City/region level segmentation  
- More portal comparisons
